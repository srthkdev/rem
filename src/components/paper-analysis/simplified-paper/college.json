      "title": "Key Components",
      "content": "The main parts of a transformer are the encoder and decoder, each built from layers of self-attention and feed-forward networks. Positional encoding helps the model understand word order."

      "title": "Advantages",
      "content": "Transformers allow for much faster training and better performance on large datasets compared to older models like RNNs and LSTMs."
